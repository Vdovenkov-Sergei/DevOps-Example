## Implementation of work with GitHub

### Main tasks

Below are the main tasks that will be implemented in this project.

1. Propose changes to the test repository using **pull request** mechanism;
2. Implement application assembly without using containerization tools (for example, `CMake`);
3. Implement application assembly using containerization tools (`Docker`);
4. Add automatic testing of the application to the project repositories when _merge_ or _push_ request is made:
    * Tests check the `correct operation of the application's functions`;
    * Tests check the `code formatting` of the application;
5. Implement one of the branching systems (**GitHub flow**);

All these tasks involve working with **GitHub Actions** and not only.
